Fix these test failures in tests/integration/source-reference.test.ts:

- should fail with invalid commit SHA: Expected error message '--source-repo-commit must be' but received 'Error: Invalid --source-repo-commit value: "not-a-valid-sha"\n\nSuggestions:\n  • Must be exactly 40 hexadecimal characters (full Git commit SHA)\n'
- should support all valid provenance types: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should update element to add source reference: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should update element with all source reference options: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should clear source reference when --clear-source-reference provided: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should fail with invalid commit SHA during update: Expected error message '--source-repo-commit must be' but received 'Error: Invalid --source-repo-commit value: "invalid-sha"\n'
- should allow updating only some source reference fields: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should display source reference information in show command: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should display repository context in show command: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should not display source section when element has no source reference: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should display source reference without symbol when not provided: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should display source reference without repository when not provided: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1
- should support complete workflow: add, update, and display: Expected exit code 0 but received exit code 1

**IMPORTANT**: For each failure:
- Identify the root cause in the source code, explore similar functionality elsewhere in the code to see how this is handled
- Evaluate if the test is still relevant and necessary, if it's not, remove it completely
- If the test is meant for functionality which is not implemented, remove the test entirely
