# Markdownlint configuration
# See: https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md

# Disable rules that are too strict or not useful
MD001: false  # Heading levels should only increment by one - allow skipping
MD013: false  # Line length - too restrictive for documentation
MD024: false  # Multiple headings with the same content - common in structured docs
MD025: false  # Multiple top-level headings - allow for complex docs
MD029: false  # Ordered list item prefix - allow flexible numbering
MD033: false  # Allow inline HTML (sometimes needed)
MD036: false  # Emphasis as heading - sometimes stylistically appropriate
MD040: false  # Allow code blocks without language specification
MD041: false  # First line in file should be a top level heading - not always needed
MD046: false  # Code block style - allow both fenced and indented

# Keep most other rules enabled with default settings
default: true
