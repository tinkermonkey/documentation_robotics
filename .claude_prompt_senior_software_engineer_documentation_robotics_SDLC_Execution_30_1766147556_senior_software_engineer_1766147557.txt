I implement clean, well thought out code with proper error handling and maintainable architecture.

**Issue Title**: Phase 1: Define SourceReference schema structure in shared definitions

**Description**:
Create the foundational SourceReference schema definition that will be referenced by all code-derived layer schemas. This establishes the data model for source code linking.

## Requirements
- FR-1: Define structured `sourceReference` object with provenance, locations, and repository fields
- FR-4: Support four provenance types: `extracted`, `manual`, `inferred`, `generated`
- FR-5: Symbol-based resolution as primary mechanism (symbol is optional, file is required)
- FR-6: Repository context capture with URL and commit SHA (both optional)
- FR-8: Non-breaking schema addition (all fields optional)

## Design Guidance
The SourceReference definition should be added to a shared definitions file that can be referenced by all layer schemas.

**Complete Schema Structure:**
```json
{
  "SourceReference": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "Links entity to source code location(s)",
    "required": ["provenance", "locations"],
    "properties": {
      "provenance": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["extracted", "manual", "inferred", "generated"],
        "description": "How this reference was created: extracted (automated ingestion), manual (human added), inferred (pattern matching), generated (code generated from model)"
      },
      "locations": {
        "type": "array",
        "minItems": 1,
        "items": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/SourceLocation"
        },
        "description": "One or more source code locations"
      },
      "repository": {
        "type": "object",
        "description": "Repository context for the source reference",
        "properties": {
          "url": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "uri",
            "description": "Git remote URL (HTTPS or SSH format)"
          },
          "commit": {
            "type": "string",
            "pattern": "^[0-9a-f]{40}$",
            "description": "Full 40-character Git commit SHA"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "SourceLocation": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["file"],
    "properties": {
      "file": {
        "type": "string",
        "minLength": 1,
        "description": "File path relative to repository root"
      },
      "symbol": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Named code element (e.g., ClassName.methodName, function_name)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Provenance Type Semantics:**
| Provenance | When Used | Behavior |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| `extracted` | `/dr-ingest` output | May be regenerated on re-ingest |
| `manual` | User explicitly added | Preserved during re-ingest |
| `inferred` | Pattern/naming convention | May be regenerated |
| `generated` | Code generated from model | Reverse traceability |

**Symbol Format by Language:**
- Python: `ClassName.method_name` or `function_name`
- TypeScript: `ClassName.methodName` or `functionName`
- Java: `ClassName.methodName`
- Go: `packageName.FunctionName`

**File Location:**
Create or update shared definitions file that can be imported by layer schemas via `$ref`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SourceReference definition created with all required fields
- [ ] SourceLocation definition created with file (required) and symbol (optional)
- [ ] Provenance enum includes all four values
- [ ] Repository object includes url and commit fields (both optional)
- [ ] Commit SHA pattern validation enforces 40-character hex
- [ ] Schema validates correctly with JSON Schema draft-07
- [ ] Code is reviewed and approved
