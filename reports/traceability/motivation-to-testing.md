# Motivation to Testing Traceability Matrix

This matrix shows how goals and requirements from the Motivation Layer
trace through the architecture layers to testing specifications.

## Traceability Chain

```
Goal → BusinessProcess → ApplicationService → TechnologyComponent → TestCase
Requirement → ApplicationService → TestSuite
```

## Goals → Testing

| Goal                             | Business | Application | Technology | Testing |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| (To be populated from spec data) |          |             |            |         |

## Requirements → Testing

| Requirement                      | Application | Test Suite | Coverage |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| (To be populated from spec data) |             |            |          |
