I implement clean, well thought out code with proper error handling and maintainable architecture.

**Issue Title**: Visualize command has CORS issues

**Description**:
When attempting to use the UX served by the `dr visualize` command, there are two failures:

1. If a client connection is established, it gets a CORs error:
Loading module from “http://localhost:8082/assets/main-B5dNpacb.js” was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type (“application/json”).
[localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/?token=tnL_6z-Fx21TRpEP43wN4uMhpiQ50JXLoP2OS-TNtiY)
Loading module from “http://localhost:8082/assets/reactflow-BKsJB92x.js” was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type (“application/json”).
[localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/?token=tnL_6z-Fx21TRpEP43wN4uMhpiQ50JXLoP2OS-TNtiY)
Loading module from “http://localhost:8082/assets/vendor-Bg4TVKJz.js” was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type (“application/json”).

2. The ux first gets a "site not available" error, so we should change the timing of when the client is launched until after the server is available
