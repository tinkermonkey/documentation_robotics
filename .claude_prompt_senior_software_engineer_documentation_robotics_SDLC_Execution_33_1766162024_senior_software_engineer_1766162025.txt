**Issue Title**: Phase 4: Add sourceReference to UX (09) and Navigation (10) layers

**Description**:
Integrate SourceReference fields into UX components and navigation routes.

## Requirements
- FR-2: Add sourceReference to entity definitions in layers 09, 10

## Design Guidance
**Layer 09 - UX Layer:**
Target entities from `09-ux-layer.schema.json`:
- `LibraryComponent` - Reusable UI component definitions
- `UXSpec` - Complete UX specifications
- `View` - Routable groupings of components

Integration pattern (following existing structure):
```json
{
  "LibraryComponent": {
    "properties": {
      "source": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "reference": {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/SourceReference"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example:
```yaml
library-components:
  - id: "order-form-component"
    name: "OrderForm"
    type: "form-field"
    source:
      reference:
        provenance: "extracted"
        locations:
          - file: "src/components/OrderForm.tsx"
            symbol: "OrderForm"
        repository:
          url: "https://github.com/acme/web-frontend.git"
          commit: "abc123..."
```

**Layer 10 - Navigation Layer:**
Target entities from `10-navigation-layer.schema.json`:
- `Route` - Single route/destination
- `NavigationGuard` - Guard conditions for route access

Example:
```yaml
routes:
  - id: "order-detail-route"
    name: "OrderDetail"
    type: "experience"
    source:
      reference:
        provenance: "extracted"
        locations:
          - file: "src/router/routes.ts"
            symbol: "orderDetailRoute"
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UX Layer LibraryComponent entity includes source reference field
- [ ] UX Layer UXSpec entity includes source reference field
- [ ] UX Layer View entity includes source reference field
- [ ] Navigation Layer Route entity includes source reference field
- [ ] Navigation Layer NavigationGuard entity includes source reference field
- [ ] Example model files demonstrate UX and navigation source linking
- [ ] Code is reviewed and approved
