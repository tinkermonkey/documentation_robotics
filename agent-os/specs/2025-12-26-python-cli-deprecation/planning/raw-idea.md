# Raw Feature Idea

**Feature Description**: Ensure that the Bun-based CLI is ready to replace the legacy Python CLI and that we can fully remove the Python CLI from the codebase.

This aligns with Phase 1 of the product roadmap which includes:

1. Complete Python-to-Bun CLI Feature Parity — Ensure Bun CLI has 100% feature parity with Python CLI across all commands, validators, and export formats. Verify through comprehensive compatibility test suite.

2. Python CLI Deprecation Path — Create deprecation notice, migration guide, and automated migration tooling to help users transition from Python to Bun CLI. Update all documentation to position Bun as primary.

The goal is to validate feature parity, create migration tooling, and safely remove the Python CLI implementation from the repository.
