## Overview

Documentation Robotics provides:

- **A Specification** - A federated data model for modeling complex software systems
- **A CLI Tool** - `dr` command for managing models according to the specification
- **Standards Integration** - Leverages ArchiMate, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, OpenTelemetry

## The Challenge

Modern software systems are complex, distributed, and constantly evolving. Working with large cross-functional teams to design, build, and maintain these systems is a significant challenge. Communicating business intent and the art of the possible across business, architecture, and engineering teams is difficult. Creating a robust feedback loop between these groups throughout the product development lifecycle / software development lifecycle is even more difficult. Good communication is required to move quickly and effectively and to manage risk, but often it's out of the reach of many organizations.

As the rate of software development accelerates with the adoption of generative AI and agentic development tools, this challenge is both increasing in scale and complexity for these large teams, but also, it is bringing these cognitive bottlenecks down to level of solo developer building with agentic tools. We can now code faster than we can effectively design, document, and communicate about what we're building. Coordinating across the various layers of a software system, from business requirements to architecture to implementation details, and creating a feedback loop which allows a developer to be confident that the output aligns with the intent is now the bottleneck for productivity.

There are many strategies and tools which help with this, but at some point to scale out the human in the loop has to transcend the implementation details and be able to reason about the system at a higher level consistently and be able to provide precise direction based on that higher level thought, and it needs to work with whatever tools are being used for implementation.

Documentation Robotics aims to address this challenge by providing a standards-based, federated approach to modeling complex software systems that is easy to use, maintain, and integrate into existing development workflows.

## The Specification

The vision for the spec is to be able to descibe what a software system is, how it works, and why it works that way. To accomplish this it needs to be comprehensive, and to make it useful it should be (as much as possible) a standards-based approach. There are many excellent standards covering much of this, and they have been used to their fullest extent; minimizing invention, but also adding some glue between them and a few "missing" layers to take a stab at a unified and holistic modeling framework that is not overly complex.

## The Tooling

The motivation for the tooling is to make it easy and efficient to create, manage, validate, and export models that conform to the specification. With the adoption of infrastructure-as-code, APM, standards like OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and OpenTelemetry, much of this data is available some form to technologists. AI-assisted development make it much easiers to generate and maintain this metadata as part of the software development lifecycle to fill in the gaps. With a unified data model and tooling, we can help architects, developers, and AI agents better understand, communicate, and evolve complex software systems.

The vision is to be able to explore adding functionality to a system at any level that we happen to be envisioning it, whether that's the business layer, application layer, API layer, data model layer, etc, and from there project those changes into the other layers to explore impact and opportunity. By having a unified model that spans all these layers, we can help ensure consistency and traceability across the entire system design.

The CLI is a quick way for both humans and automated systems (CI/CD, AI agents, etc.) to manage these models in a collaborative manner. From the CLI, tools like sub-agents, custom commands, and other automation can be built to further streamline the process of managing system models in a way that is not tied to a specific ecosystem or vendor. We've started with a Claude Code integration to enable natural language interaction with the models, but the vision is to enable a wide variety of integrations and automation around this unified data model.
